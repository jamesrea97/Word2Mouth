## Motivation

Although the practicality and potential of these new eLearning platforms have been much praised by 
developed countries, the unforeseen differences in technological and educational background between Learners from High Income and 
Low Income countries (HIC and LIC respectively) imply these platforms are often inaccessible for low literacy/Internet environments in developing countries countries who need education the most.

This project has been designed to meet this humanitarian need. More specifically, we designed and engineered Word2Moth, an Android-based educational platform that can provide:

- A novel course/lecture creation tool for Teachers to design their own OER content using their own media resources in their chosen language and pedagogy, all this right from their hand-held device.


- An offline sharing functionality to share Open Educational Resource (OER) through Bluetooth when Learners are in no Internet zones.


- An online OER store that uses Google's Firebase Services for Learners/Teachers to download/upload educational content from anywhere with Internet, accessible using Google's Text-To-Speech API.


- Indispensable metrics for Teachers to track the current popularity of their uploaded OER from within Word2Mouth.
